# Evolving Soft Robots

This repository contains an evolutionary algorithm designed to evolve soft robots. The framework is built using basic NumPy operations, employing Numba decorators for optimization, and integrates Taichi for the simulation part, enhancing computational efficiency.

## Dependencies
The framework is built using the following libraries:
| Package               | Version (>=) |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| numpy                 | 2.0.1        |
| taichi                | 0.6.1        |
| numba                 | 0.6.1        |
