# Evolutionary Algorithm for evolving soft robots
This repo incudes an evolutionary algorithm to evolve soft robots. The framework is build with basic numpy operations using numba decorators and taichi for the simulator part for enhanced computational efficiency.

# Dependecies
To run the EA the following libraries are required
1) numpy
2) numba 
3) taichi
